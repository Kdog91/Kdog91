📊 Kevin Simmons' Data Engineering Portfolio

Welcome to my GitHub portfolio! I’m Kevin, an aspiring Data Engineer with experience in building high-performance data pipelines, optimizing data structures, and engineering solutions to process large-scale datasets. This repository highlights a selection of my technical projects—spanning C++, Python, and SQL—focused on real-world data challenges, algorithm performance, and backend automation.

🚀 Featured Projects

🔧 Auction Bid Data Processor
Description:
A C++ application utilizing a custom singly linked list to store, search, and manage over 12,000 municipal auction bids. Built with efficient memory management (verified via Valgrind) and a command-line interface for end-to-end data operations.

Key Features:

O(1) append/prepend operations
In-place CSV ingestion and cleanup
Console interface for bid loading, searching, and deletion
Tech: C++, Data Structures, Memory Optimization

🧠 Hash-Based Bid Indexing System
Description:
Built a high-efficiency hash table with linked list chaining and FNV-1a hashing to enable constant-time lookup and insertions of auction bid data.

Key Features:

98% load factor efficiency
Robust collision resolution
Fast CSV-to-index data loading
Tech: C++, Hash Algorithms, Data Indexing

⚡ Bid Sorting Benchmark Tool
Description:
A benchmark system that compares QuickSort and Selection Sort over 12,000+ data records. Provides execution time metrics and performance visualizations for each algorithm.

Key Features:

CSV parsing and timing instrumentation
Demonstrates 260x performance difference (0.04s vs. 10.6s)
In-memory vector storage with custom benchmarking logic
Tech: C++, Algorithms, Performance Tuning

📈 Tableau-Driven KPI Dashboard (ETL Intern Project)
Description:
As part of my internship, I developed SQL-based ETL pipelines and created dynamic Tableau dashboards to monitor customer engagement metrics and backend data health.

Key Contributions:

Reduced report generation time by 35%
Streamlined data quality using Python preprocessing
Integrated live KPI dashboards used by executive team
Tech: SQL, Python, Tableau, ETL Pipelines

🏦 Banking Investment Calculator
Description:
A Python-based CLI tool for forecasting financial growth using both simple and compound interest formulas. Includes user input validation and summary generation.

Tech: Python, Financial Math, CLI Tools

📚 Other Projects (Honorable Mentions)

C--Debug: Debugging practice and memory toolkits in C++
Time-Manager-System: CLI-based productivity and scheduling tracker
algorithm-visualizer: Tool to visualize and animate search/sort algorithms
credit-fix-app: Financial coaching app to assist users with credit strategy
